The NSLS-II Detector Group has produced a series of electrometer designs for various synchrotron applications. The first, NSLS_EM, was a simple design for measuring very small currents, in the nanoamp to microamp range. It has four inputs and is driven by a host-based soft IOC, similar to most of the commercial offerings. NSLS2_EM was aimed at BPM applications, and larger currents, from microamps to milliamps. It had an embedded IOC, based on an FPGA with dual hard processor cores (Zynq 7C030). That allowed more functionality. Using that same platform, there have been variants of the basic design. NSLS2I_EM provides individual gain settings for each channel, for applications other than beam position monitoring.

Another variant is under development following user responses to NSLS2_EM. We have added four channels of analog voltage input and eight bits of digital I/O; four in and four out. We will call this NSLS2_MIO, and details will be posted when available.

NSLS2_IC is a complete stand-alone ionization chamber with embedded IOC, electrometer and HV bias supply. It has two readout channels, fed from a split ion chamber electrode, and can provide 1-D position monitoring. It is based on the same integrator technology as the NSLS_EM unit, but with only two channels. The 2-channel integrator chip provides for an off-chip integration capacitor, and hence some flexibility in the maximum current capability. It currently can handle 2.5uA of ion current, and provide a bias of up to 1000V. The ionization chamber itself has an aperture of 40mm x 5mm, and is 140mm long. The combination of the current integrator technology, the absence of ground loops and the completely enclosed design provides an extremely low noise level.
